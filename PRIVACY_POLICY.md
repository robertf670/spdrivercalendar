**Privacy Policy for Spare Driver Shift Calendar**

**Effective Date:** 28th March 2025

**1. Introduction**

Welcome to Spare Driver Shift Calendar (the "App"), provided by Robert Fitzsimons ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application. Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.

We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Effective Date" of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates.

**2. Information We Collect**

We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the App depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:

*   **Locally Stored Data:**
    *   **Shift & Event Data:** Information you manually enter into the app regarding your work shifts, including dates, start/end times, shift types, duty codes, notes, assigned buses, and rest days configuration. This data is primarily stored locally on your device.
    *   **Application Settings:** Preferences such as dark/light mode settings, notification preferences (e.g., reminder offset), and onboarding status (e.g., whether you've completed the welcome screen). This data is stored locally on your device.
*   **Google Account Information (via Google Sign-In):**
    *   **Basic Profile Information:** If you choose to connect your Google Account for calendar synchronization, we use Google Sign-In. Google provides us with basic profile information associated with your account, such as your email address, primarily to identify your account for the connection. We store the status of your Google login locally on your device.
*   **Google Calendar Data (with your explicit permission):**
    *   **Calendar Events:** If you grant permission, the App will access your primary Google Calendar to read event data (to potentially display alongside your shifts, if implemented) and/or write event data (to save your work shifts to your Google Calendar). See Section 4 for details.

**3. How We Use Your Information**

Having accurate information permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the App to:

*   Create and manage your work shifts and events within the App's calendar.
*   Calculate shift details based on internal logic or data.
*   Display your configured work schedule and rest days.
*   Synchronize (read from and/or write to) your work shifts with your primary Google Calendar, **only if you explicitly authenticate and grant permission**.
*   Schedule local notifications to remind you of upcoming shifts, based on your preferences.
*   Save your preferences and settings (e.g., theme, notification timing).
*   Manage your account connection status with Google.

**4. Google Calendar Integration (OAuth 2.0)**

To provide the optional Google Calendar synchronization feature, the App utilizes Google's OAuth 2.0 authentication system (via Google Sign-In) and the Google Calendar API.

*   **Authentication:** When you choose to connect your Google Calendar, you will be directed to Google's secure authentication screen to log in to your Google Account and grant permissions to the App.
*   **Requested Permissions (Scopes):** We request access to the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events` scope. This permission allows the App to:
    *   View events on your calendars.
    *   Create, change, and delete events on your calendars.
*   **Purpose of Access:** The App requests this permission *solely* for the purpose of:
    *   Reading events from your primary Google Calendar to potentially display them within the App (if this feature is implemented).
    *   Writing your work shift events, as generated or managed within the App, to your primary Google Calendar.
*   **Data Usage:** We will only access and manipulate Google Calendar data as necessary to perform the synchronization functions you initiate or configure within the App. We do not use this access for any other purpose, nor do we share your Google Calendar data with any third parties (other than Google as necessary to use their API).
*   **Revoking Access:** You can revoke the App's access to your Google Account at any time through your Google Account security settings page: [https://myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions). If you revoke access, the Google Calendar synchronization feature will stop working.

**5. Data Sharing and Disclosure**

We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your personal information or locally stored data with third parties for their marketing purposes.

We may disclose information:

*   **As Required By Law:** If required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).
*   **With Google:** Information is implicitly shared with Google when using Google Sign-In and the Google Calendar API as part of their service operation. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy ([https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)).

**6. Data Storage and Security**

*   **Local Storage:** Most of your shift data and application settings are stored directly on your mobile device using standard application storage mechanisms.
*   **Security Measures:** We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information stored locally. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Data stored locally on your device is subject to the security of the device itself.
*   **Google Data Security:** Data stored within your Google Account (like your Google Calendar events) is subject to Google's security practices.

**7. Data Retention**

We retain the information stored locally on your device as long as the App is installed or until you manually delete the data or the App itself. Information synchronized with your Google Calendar remains in your Google Calendar according to your Google account settings and Google's policies.

**8. User Rights and Choices**

*   **Access and Modify:** You can typically access and modify your shift data and settings directly within the App.
*   **Delete Data:** You can delete individual shifts or events within the App. Uninstalling the App will remove locally stored data.
*   **Google Calendar Sync:** You can connect or disconnect the Google Calendar sync feature within the App's settings (if applicable) or revoke access via your Google Account settings at any time.
*   **Notifications:** You can manage notification permissions and settings through your device's operating system settings.

**9. Children's Privacy**

This App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected such information, we will take steps to delete it.

**10. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Effective Date" and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
